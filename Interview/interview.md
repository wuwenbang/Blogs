Good morning, my name is Wu Wenbang. It’s really a great honor to have this opportunity for a interview. Now I will introduce myself briefly. I am graduated from Changshu Institute of Technology，and my major is Information Science and Engineering. I have been working in Maice Data Technology Company for more than a year and a half as Front-end Enginer. I am mainly responsible for the development of the citizen information system.  Moreover I have experience in mobile websit and the WeChat small program development. The technologies I mainly use include React, TypeScript, Node, Less and so on. In my spare time, I often write some technical blogs and visit some technical websites like stackoverflow, dev, juejin and so on. So I also hope your company can choose me. I will try my best and not let you down.
